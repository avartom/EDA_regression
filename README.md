# EDA_regression
Objectives:
Buying a house is a stressful process. We want to use machine learning to provide additional information. In this notebook, we want to build a model to predict the prices of residential homes in Ames, Iowa. This model will provide buyers with a rough estimate of what the houses are actually worth.

This notebook is divided into 4 sections:
Data Description,
Exploratory Data Analyis or EDA (in short),
Load and understand the data using pandas,
Variable identification,
Univariate analysis,
Target variable analysis,
Deal with Missing values,
Generating new features,
Transforming Categorical Variables using Scikit-Learn,
Check skewness or distribution of numeric variables,
Getting dummy categorical features.


Multivariate analysis

Correlation matrix,
Relation Exploration for Few Numerical Variables and categorical features,
Dealing with Outliers,
Feature selection using Wrapper Methods,
Forward selection,
Preditct house prices (linear regression and XGBOOSTER),
About Linear Regression,
Linear Regression using Statsmodels,
Interpreting the Regression Results,
Making Predictions based on the Regression Results,
Predict house price using sklearn linear regression and XGBRegressor,
Splitting the dataset into training and testing,
Build models (Linear Regression and XGBRegressor)
